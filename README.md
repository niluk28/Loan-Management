# XYZ Bank
Created a loan management system in java to practice and refine my skills and knowledge to code.
This project is designed to register and manage credit records for XYZBank customers. It allows for the entry, updating, and retrieval of various loan details, including:
Record ID
Customer ID
Type of loan (Auto, Builder, Mortgage, Personal, or Other)
Interest rate
Amount left to pay (in thousands of pounds)
Loan term left (in years)
The system features a record class to represent individual loan records and a main XYZBank class to manage an array of these records. Users can define the maximum number of records, input loan details, and view all registered records in a tabular format.
